# MRBase {#mr_mrbase}

You took the easy way out. No shame in that. Your choice. Right, so as I wrote, *[MRBase](http://www.mrbase.org/){target="blank"}* is very easy to handle. It is based on the `TwoSampleMR` package and uses the `MRInstruments` package to load in all the genetic instruments. The creators of MRBase have curated hundreds of GWAS and molecular QTL studies, and prepared the data for easy use on the website and in the R packages.

Using **[MRBase](http://www.mrbase.org/){target="blank"}** we intend to find out whether Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) causes coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke.

You are almost at the end. Time to return to the previous chapter on post-GWAS analyses \@ref(post-gwas).
