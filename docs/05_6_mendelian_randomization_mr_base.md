Right, so as I wrote, **[MRBase](http://www.mrbase.org/){target="blank"}** is very easy to handle.

The creators of MRBase have curated hundreds of GWAS and molecular QTL studies, and prepared the data for easy use on the website and in the R packages.

Using **[MRBase](http://www.mrbase.org/){target="blank"}** we intend to find out whether Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) causes coronary artery disease.

You are almost at the end. Time to return to the previous chapter on post-GWAS analyses \@ref(post-gwas).
