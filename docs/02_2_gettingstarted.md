# Getting started {#getting-started}

Before getting started, we need to discuss computers, specifically your computer. Most programs made to execute genetic epidemiology studies are developed for the Unix environment, for example Linux and macOS. So, they may not work as intended in a Windows environment. Windows does allow users to install a linux subsystem within Windows 10+ and you can find the detail [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about){target="_blank"} here.  

However, I highly recommend one of two options. 

- One, install a linux subsystem on your Windows computer (for example [a virtual machine with Ubuntu could work](https://blog.storagecraft.com/the-dead-simple-guide-to-installing-a-linux-virtual-machine-on-windows/){target="_blank"}). 
- Two, switch to macOS in combination with [homebrew](https://brew.sh){target="_blank"}. This will give you all the flexibility to use Unix-based programs for your genetic epidemiology work and at the same time you'll keep the advantage of a powerful computer with a user-friendly interface.

I chose the latter. 

> For this practical every command is intended for Linux/macOS, in other words Unix-systems.

## CoCalc vs. Standalone

For the purpose of this practical primer there are one of two steps you can to take to get started. 

- When you are following the course, you were invited to the [CoCalc server](https://cocalc1.science.uu.nl){target="_blank"} of this course. So, you will want to read the section **CoCalc**. 
- When you want to use this book as a standalone, you should check out the instructions in section **Standalone** - this is probably also the section you want to follow for real-world cases. 

But first, I'll briefly provide some background on the various programs that are commonly used Chapter \@ref(getting-started-programs).
