This is an example of a GitBook for teaching, generated using 
R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 

The example
is based on the minimal bookdown example by Yihui Xie, available at
https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown-demo.
Please see the page "[Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)" at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ for how to compile this example into HTML. You may generate a copy of the book in `bookdown::pdf_book` format by calling `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::pdf_book')`. More detailed instructions are available here https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/build-the-book.html.
