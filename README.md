# A Practical Primer in Human Complex Genetics

_A Practical Primer in Human Complex Genetics_ was originally written for the the **Genetic Epidemiology** course organized by the [Master Epidemiology](https://epidemiology-education.nl) of Utrecht University, but can be used as a practical guide and companion to learning and doing a genome-wide association study (GWAS).

It is available as [GitBook](https://swvanderlaan.github.io//A_Practical_Primer_in_Human_Complex_Genetics/), PDF, and EPUB.

This book was made possible by the kind help of Caspar J. van Lissa who wrote an excellent instruction through an example GitBook https://cjvanlissa.github.io/gitbook-demo/.
