I provide a list of things to do, to improve, to alter, to edit or to add. Crazy ideas. Useful tips, tricks, or links. 

Obviously this list is not exhaustive nor intended for practical use for anyone else but me.

Add an image above the title:

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62074546/add-image-before-bookdown-title

But it causes an issue, described [here](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=206086). So you better remove this chunk of code:


```
\```{js, echo = FALSE}
title=document.getElementById('header');
title.innerHTML = '<img src="img/_headers/banner_man_standing_dna.png" alt="A Practical Primer in Human Complex Genetics">' + title.innerHTML
\```
```


<!-- ```{js, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- title=document.getElementById('header'); -->
<!-- title.innerHTML = '<img src="img/_headers/banner_man_standing_dna.png" alt="To-do">' + title.innerHTML -->
<!-- ``` -->
